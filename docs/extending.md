## Extending (creating plugins) ##

#### 1. Build aTarantula project. ####

After successfully building the project, you will have "aTarantula Plug-in" template available, when
creating a new Xcode Project.

#### 2. Create a new Xcode Project from "aTarantula Plug-in" template. ####

#### 3. Build your plugin. ####

#### 4. Open "Derived Data" directory for your plugin and find there your built ".bundle" ####

#### 5. Copy it to `~/Library/aTarantula/Plugins` ####

Or, it may be better to symlink it, if you intend to develop continuously.

#### 6. Start up aTarantula ####
